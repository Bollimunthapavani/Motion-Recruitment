Step-by-Step Approach to Document AWS Setup and Git Operations
1. Create a New Branch Named "feature-aws-setup":
Start from the main branch in your Git repository.
Create a branch named feature-aws-setup.
2. Document the AWS Setup Steps:
a. Creating an AWS Account:

Visit AWS Website:
Go to aws.amazon.com.
Click on "Create an AWS Account":
Follow the prompts to enter your email address, select an account name, and complete the registration process.
Verify Your Email and Phone Number:
Provide your contact information and verify via email and phone number.
Choose an Account Type:
Select the account type based on your usage (Free Tier for basic exploration).
Payment Information:
Provide valid payment information. Note that the Free Tier often has limitations.
Support Plan:
Choose a basic support plan to avoid additional costs.
Complete Registration:
Finish the registration process and sign in to the AWS Management Console.
b. Setting Up a Basic EC2 Instance:

Log in to AWS Management Console:
Access the console through aws.amazon.com.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:
In the Services menu, select EC2.
Launch a New Instance:
Click on "Launch Instance."
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
Select an appropriate AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 AMI).
Choose an Instance Type:
Select t2.micro for Free Tier eligibility.
Configure Instance Details:
Configure options such as network, subnet, auto-assign Public IP, etc.
Add Storage:
Choose the default storage allocation or customize based on your needs.
Add Tags:
Key: Name, Value: my-ec2-instance (add meaningful tags to identify your instance).
Configure Security Group:
Create a new security group to allow SSH (port 22) from your IP.
Review and Launch:
Review the configuration settings and launch the instance.
Select or Create a Key Pair for SSH Access:
Download the key pair (.pem file) for SSH access to your instance.
c. Deploying a Sample Python Script:

SSH into Your EC2 Instance:
Use the key pair to SSH into the instance from your terminal: ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@<public-ip>.
Install Python:
Install Python on your EC2 instance if it's not already installed.
Create a Python Script:
Create a file named add_numbers.py with a script that adds two numbers.
Run the Python Script:
Execute the Python script using the Python interpreter.
3. Add the Steps to a Markdown File:
In the feature-aws-setup branch, create a file named aws-setup.md.
Document the steps outlined above in aws-setup.md.
4. Commit Your Changes:
Commit the aws-setup.md file with an appropriate commit message, e.g., "Document steps for setting up an AWS EC2 instance and deploying a Python script."
5. Merge the "feature-aws-setup" Branch Back into the Main Branch:
Switch back to the main branch.
Merge the feature-aws-setup branch into the main branch to integrate the changes.
By following these detailed steps, you can ensure that the setup and documentation process for AWS is clear and comprehensive. This approach also guarantees that your Git operations are systematic and organized.
